Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
In this Project, We build a customer help bot with smart document understanding.
If the customer asks simple questions then chatbot can answer it itself using preloaded answers in Watson Discovery Service.
If the question is typical then the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. 
This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
